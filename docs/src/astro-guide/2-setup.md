# Setup

We recommend you setup an AtomicServer on a networked machine like a VPS and couple it to a domain name you intend to use for the final product as this can be difficult to change later.

For example if you intend to build a portfolio website with the domain `my-portfolio.com` you could couple your atomic server to `atomic.my-portfolio.com`.

For instructions on how to install Atomic Server see: [Atomic Server Docs: Setup / Installation](../atomicserver/installation.md)
