# Setup

We recommend you setup an atomic server on a networked machine like a VPS and couple it to a domain name you intend to use for the final product as this can be difficult to change later.

for example if you intend to build a portfolio website with the domain `my-portfolio.com` you could couple your atomic server to `atomic.my-portfolio.com`.
